\begin{frame}{Details + Explanation}

Let's go over the syllabus!

\begin{itemize}
\item What this class is about: this is my first time teaching it, so there is a lot of space for adjustment.

\item Basic programming skills = you know \textit{some} language and can write a short program. Extra helpful if you can make functions/subroutines.

\item I give bonus points for
  \begin{itemize}
  \item submitting a pull request to correct course notes
  \item submitting your homework as a link to a Git repo (note: I still need to be able to figure out what on earth you did)
  \end{itemize}
If you don't know how to use Git...
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{References \& Resources}

\begin{itemize}
\item The links in the syllabus are clickable; many are repeated in the helpful resources page.

\item There are a lot of books listed: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item some are available electronically
  \item I have extra copies of Lewis \& Miller in my office for loan
  \item mostly you'll just use course notes 
  \end{itemize}

\item I haven't actually decided if we'll use MCNP. If you're interested in it for a final project (a) request access now, (b) you might want to request exe only, (c) I won't let you use MCNP for a final project unless you already have experience with it or you make a very compelling case.

\begin{frame}{What are we trying to accomplish?}
\begin{itemize}
\item The challenge of designing a nuclear reactor is to make it as \textbf{economical} as possible while ensuring its \textbf{safety}. \vspace*{1 em}
\item This is not an easy task! \vspace*{1 em}
\item The principle of a nuclear reactor is relatively simple:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{Fission} creates heat within the nuclear fuel,
\item The \underline{heat} is conducted to the fuel cladding surface and to the coolant,
\item The heat is subsequently transported by a coolant through heat exchangers and ultimately to a \underline{steam} conversion plant.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{What are we trying to accomplish?}
\begin{itemize}
\item In order to design economical and safe reactors, one must choose among a vast range of competing designs:
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the \alert{best} fuels, structure, and coolant materials; what are their appropriate ratios?
\item How does the reactor respond to component failures?
\item How does one balance those choices given competing goals of performance, lifetime, safety, and capital cost? \vspace*{1 em}
\end{itemize}
\item Ideally, one would like to base these choices on theory rather than experimental trial and error \vspace*{1 em}
\item This is where \textcolor{dgreen}{computational science} fits in...

\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced the burden of experiment
\item Contributed greatly to reactor design
\end{itemize}
\item However, modeling was severely constrained 
%Even state-of-the-art machines such as Cray-1 were 
\begin{itemize}
\item Unable to explicitly model the key physical phenomena within a reactor
\item Low-dimensional representation
\item Lumped parameter models

%"Traditionally, reactor models for radiation dose assessments have considered just the reactor core, or a small part of the core," Wagner says. "However, we're now simulating entire nuclear facilities, such as a nuclear power reactor facility with its auxiliary buildings and the ITER fusion reactor, with much greater accuracy than any other organization that we're aware of." 
%
%More accurate models enable nuclear plants to be designed with more accurate safety margins and shielding requirements, which helps to improve safety and reduce costs. The technology that makes this sort of leading-edge simulation possible is a combination of ORNL's Jaguar, the world's fastest supercomputer; advanced transport methods; and a next-generation software package called Denovo.
